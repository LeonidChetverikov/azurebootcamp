You can use Docker to run a standalone Linux container with the Azure CLI preinstalled. Docker gets you started quickly with an isolated environment to run the CLI in. 
The image can also be used as a base for your own deployments.
# Start the Docker container with Azure CLI preinstalled
1. Open a command prompt and then start the Docker container with Azure CLI preinstalled using the following command.
   ```
       docker run -it mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli
   ```
